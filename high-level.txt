nc_open("file.nc", ...)

nc_open_reduce("file.nc", "max()")


normally:
writer: produces some data (say 10 MB each)
  -> write the data via ESDM
read: I want this data => blocks until data is ready
  -> ESDM + X "WP4/WP5 API" we will have the offloading, open (please apply this operator already)

streaming:
- open()
- stream = apply_op("x")
- stream.apply(offset =[0,0,0], size = [100,100,100])
  - once data is ready, the stream operators they are applied in any order
  - once completed, read completes
- threading is already implemented in ESDM

We should prototype some interfaces in a light-weight fashion.
- WP5 => use-cases to be defined to motivate the work
- Use-case for in-situ
