# Function Shipping Example

The purpose is to foster discussion of capabilities.

The library in ./emulation provides a development kit for function shipping.
In test/ there is test code showing
  - how a reduction happens traditionally in the client.
  - how reduction could be executed on the server (that uses the emulation/dev kit)
The run.sh script contains everything to build and run the both test applications.
